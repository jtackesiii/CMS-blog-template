The Krishna Janmbhumi grounds are one of Mathura's main draws as a pilgrimage site. The present complex is quite a sight -- several temples are complemented by a large stage, two series of dioramas exhibiting Krishna's divine exploits (one stationary, the other animatronic), a library, a bookstore, multiple tea and snacks kiosks, and over twenty souvenir shops. There is also a primary school and cow shelter onsite, though these are less visible to visitors. This array of structures is semi-recent -- the Shri Krishna Janmbhumi Trust (est. Feb. 21, 1951) broke ground on October 15, 1953, with the imposing Bhagavat Bhawan finished on February 12, 1982.^[_Shrīkr̥ṣṇa Janmsthān Smārikā_, Delhi: Radha Press, 1982, 123-25.]
