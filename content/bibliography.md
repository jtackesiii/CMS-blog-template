Blackburn, Anne M. “Buddha-Relics in the Lives of Southern Asian Polities.” Numen, vol. 57, no. 3/4, 2010, pp. 317–40. JSTOR, <http://www.jstor.org/stable/20789595>. Accessed October 2022. This article works to explain the power and significance sites with Buddhist relics hold.The author traces how the religious power of the relics is transformed to a “built landscape” that connects religious tenets with local and regional histories of monastic culture and “courtly rule”.  As a result, the author concludes that the sites \[on which the relics are installed] hold a unique power.  This article offers key insights in how the physical construct of the Temple of the Tooth reinforces its social and political import - both in historical and modern day Sri Lanka.

 

 DeVotta, Neil. Sinhalese Buddhist Nationalist Ideology: Implications for Politics and Conflict Resolution in Sri Lanka. East-West Center, 2007. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep06528. Accessed October 2022.  This article explores the dark side of the political appropriation of Buddhism and Buddhist culture in Sri Lanka.  The author argues that political Buddhism has strengthened in the past half century and is now merged with a nationalist ideology in Sri Lanka. The author further argues that this ideology is partly justified using mytho-history, which in turn partially dictates how people interact with sacred spaces such as the Temple of the Tooth. The argues that the ideology compromises the moral, ethical, and peaceful values of Buddhism and undermines democratic governance.  This article emphasizes how political considerations may modify how/why spaces are privileged as “sacred”.

 

Mukherjee, Sraman. “RELICS IN TRANSITION: Material Mediations in Changing Worlds.” Ars Orientalis, vol. 48, 2018, pp. 20–42. JSTOR, <http://www.jstor.org/stable/45239350>. Accessed October 2022. Although a Buddhist relic is often significant due to its direct relation to the Buddha himself, those relics are still able to take on new identities. This text outlines the British effect on the tooth relic as well as the Portuguese seizure and eventual desecration of the tooth relic. The book also touches on the honor code within the archaeological community and how forged antiques can also work to rewrite the history of the relics themselves. With Rama V having been denied the ability to touch the tooth, he put into question the legitimacy of the tooth. Also, Mukherjee details the moral and political authority possession of the tooth yields. 

 

Nell, Andreas. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, no. 4, 1932, pp. 982–83. JSTOR, <http://www.jstor.org/stable/25194627>. Accessed October 2022. In this book, Andreas Nell provides a rough framework of how the Temple of the Tooth developed its architecture over time. Specifically, how its unique Kandyan architecture was able to develop during a period where there was an absence of European influence allowing it to develop on its own. Nell notes how the surviving salient features of the temple act as a framework to investigate Ceylon archaeology and provides missing pieces of information in the history of that time period. Understanding the complete history of the architecture of the temple is critical because it provides a holistic view of the temple’s features.

Silva, Kapila D. “MAPPING MEANING IN THE CITY IMAGE: A CASE STUDY OF KANDY, SRI LANKA.” Journal of Architectural and Planning Research, vol. 28, no. 3, 2011, pp. 229–51. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/43030943. Accessed October 2022. This study uses Kandy, the location of the Temple of the Sacred Tooth, as a case study for exploring the interaction between the psychological view of environmental cognition (which emphasizes knowing the environment)  and the anthropological view of environmental cognition (which emphasizes making the environment meaningful).  The author conducts a deep exploration of how local peoples interact with the city fo Kandy.  Through these interviews, the author concludes that environmental cognition is “how we make our environment meaningful by knowing it, imposing order on it, and relating ourselves to such ordered milieu”. This study offers unique and direct insights into how local dwellers of Kandy view their relationship with the Temple of the Tooth.

 

Stanley-Price, Nicholas. Cultural Heritage in Postwar Recovery, 4 October 2005, https://www.iccrom.org/sites/default/files/publications/2019-11/iccrom_ics06_culturalheritagepostwar_en_0_0.pdf. Accessed October 2022.  Through an examination of the destruction of the Temple of the Tooth by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam, this article highlights the political and social importance of the temple in Sri Lankan culture.  In addition, through the framework of restoration, the article explores the cultural function  of the Temple.  The author notes that, in the restoration, the community accepted contemporary interpretation of the temple, without insisting on the restoration of the temple’s architecture of a particular period. In this way, the author concludes that the community valued a functional restoration more than a physical restoration. This article addresses the modern role of the Temple of the Tooth in Sri Lankan society.



Strong, John S., and Professor John S. Strong. The Buddha's Tooth: Western Tales of a Sri Lankan Relic. University of Chicago Press, 2021.  This work investigates how the stories surrounding the Buddha’s tooth evolved over time and the west’s evolving understanding of Buddhism after its initial colonial encounter.  Strong’s history of the tooth is described as “one continuous saga of stories reflective of changing European mindsets”.  Strong contrasts the Portuguese imperialists, who ridiculed the tooth as a symbol of ignorance of the idolaters, to the British approach, who wanted the tooth to be ceremoniously reinstated as a symbol of their religious tolerance. By taking a deep dive into the way the imperialists attempted to destroy and then appropriate the meaning of the sacred Tooth, this work underscores the vital cultural role of the Tooth and a shared “sacred narrative” in Sri Lankan history.  In addition, this historical background provides key insight into the role of the tooth in modern Sri Lanka.

 

Wickramasinghe, Nira. “History as Heritage: Producing the Present in Post-War Sri Lanka.” Cultural Heritage Ethics: Between Theory and Practice, edited by Constantine Sandis, 1st ed., Open Book Publishers, 2014, pp. 43–56. JSTOR, <http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1287k16.10>. Accessed October 2022. This text takes a critical stance on how elites in Sri Lanka have modified the theoretical construct of “heritage” for their own political purposes.  The author details the evolution of the concept of “heritage” in Sri Lanka from the early twentieth century, when “heritage” was invoked  to create pride in the nation in the making.  Later, in the 1970s, “heritage” was leveraged to transform an agrarian society into a market-oriented export processing zone. The author argues that in the past 20 years, “heritage” has once again been repurposed to depoliticise citizens and to mute any possible dissent. This article supplies a novel lens through which to understand the evolving role of the Temple of the Tooth in Sri Lankan society and the purposeful appropriation of “heritage” for various political purposes.

I, 2000, pp. 99-108.  This article details the restoration of the Temple of the Tooth Temple after it was bombed in 1998 by Tamil terrorists who were fighting for a separate state within the country. The author, who was the Conservator in charge of the restoration project, describes how underlying cultural values affected the restoration process. In describing the considerations around restoration, the author demonstrates how the Temple belongs to a living religious tradition which sometimes were at odds with professional conservation ethics. Moreover, the author depicts how conservators were faced with negotiating a host of political, social and religious issues.
